Vulnerability Assessment Report
===============================
Project Description:
---------------------
This project involves conducting a vulnerability assessment for an e-commerce company's 
remote database server. The goal is to identify risks, evaluate their potential impact, 
and propose remediation strategies to enhance the organization's security posture. 
This report demonstrates skills in risk analysis, threat identification, and 
proactive cybersecurity planning.

Part 1: Purpose Section
------------------------
The database server is crucial for the e-commerce company as it stores sensitive customer 
and business data and supports remote employee operations globally. Securing the server 
is essential to prevent unauthorized access, protect customer privacy, and maintain business 
continuity. If the server is compromised or disabled, it could lead to data breaches, operational 
disruptions, and reputational damage. This vulnerability analysis aims to identify potential 
risks and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate these threats.

Part 2: Risk Assessment
------------------------
| Threat Source           | Threat Event                              | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk (Likelihood x Severity) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Malicious hackers        | Unauthorized access through SQL injection | 3                | 3              | 9                            |
| Insider threat           | Data exfiltration by a disgruntled employee | 2               | 3              | 6                            |
| Malware/automated attacks| Ransomware infection via exposed server ports | 3             | 2              | 6                            |

Part 3: Approach Section
-------------------------
The risks identified were selected based on their potential impact on the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of the database server. Malicious hackers, insiders, and malware 
attacks were prioritized due to their likelihood of occurrence and high potential for damage. 
These threats represent significant risks to the organization, including operational disruptions, 
financial losses, and reputational harm. Analyzing these risks helps guide targeted security 
measures for the organization.

Part 4: Remediation Section
----------------------------
To address the identified risks, the company should implement a multi-layered security approach. 
First, enforce the principle of least privilege to limit insider access to sensitive data. Second, 
enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the database to prevent unauthorized 
logins. Third, secure the database by closing unused ports, applying patches promptly, and using input 
validation to mitigate SQL injection risks. Finally, establish regular monitoring and logging to detect 
and respond to threats proactively.
